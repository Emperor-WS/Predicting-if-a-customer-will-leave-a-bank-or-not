# Predicting-if-a-customer-will-leave-a-bank-or-not
The project is based on a fictional bank with a dataset of 10000 customer and by using Deep Learning I made an algorithm using ANN and XGBoost that achieved an 86% correct prediction

I used sklearn, tensorflow, xgboost, keras, numpy, matplotlib and pandas\
the problem correct prediction cannont exceed 86-87% correct prediction because its limited by the problem itself
